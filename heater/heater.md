Heater and manifold notes
=========================

Work to do on manifold frame
----------------------------

Add upright angle iron, with flat top with bolt hole, 5cm high from
bottom of motor holder, to front of motor holder, centred about 6cm
from edge of motor holder.

This will connect the central motor to the central valve, via another
lever on the existing hole above the central valve.

The motor on the left (as seen from facing towards the heater outlet)
will control the upper valve, and the one on the right the lower
valve.

The tallest upright should come down by 2cm.

Add another pivot holder on the outside of the upper right.

Move the lower right pivot holder back, maybe shorten by 1cm.
