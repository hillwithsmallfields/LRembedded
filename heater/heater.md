Heater and manifold notes
=========================

Work to do on manifold frame
----------------------------

Add upright angle iron, with flat top with bolt hole, 5cm high from
bottom of motor holder, to front of motor holder, centred about 6cm
from edge of motor holder.

This will connect the central motor to the central valve, via another
lever on the existing hole above the central valve.

The motor on the left (as seen from facing towards the heater outlet)
will control the upper valve, and the one on the right the lower
valve.

TODO: Add another pivot holder on the outside of the upper right,
      but put it on the outside and under the frame.  Hole about 4cm
      from motor holder.

TODO: cover over motors: 260 wide x 72 high x 92 deep, 23mm above top
      of lower part of bracket; link to lower part of motor bracket is
      towards rear.

TODO: side pieces for lower part of motor holder: on the outside of
      the crosspieces.

TODO: lower motor lower lever: 5cm to hole on input side, 7cm to hole
      on on output side.
      
TODO: lower motor long lever 6cm + 10cm.

TODO: plate forward from small support on motor holder, bringing hole
      forward 15mm and left 10mm.

TODO: middle motor upper lever 3cm+3cm between holes.

TODO: middle motor long lever 8cm up 4cm back to holes.

TODO: turn upper left lever support half-turn and move forward 1cm.

TODO: upper motor upper lever 4cm from outside 4cm forward to holes.

Introduction
============

The Ebersp√§cher D7L heater blows air into a tree of Y-valves, operated
by motors controlled by an Arduino, which has four incoming request
lines.  It adjusts the valve positions to share the hot air between
the active requests.
