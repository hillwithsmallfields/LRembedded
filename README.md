Embedded controllers for my Land Rover

I rebuilt and stretched a Land Rover a few years ago, and am starting
to add some microcontrollers.

battery_monitor_charger
=======================

A raspberry pi based system in my garage, connected to the vehicle
batteries by an umbilical, that monitors the voltage and switches a
charger on as needed; also alerts me if the battery connection is lost.

central
=======

An ADK Mega that looks at lots of status lines and communicates with
an Android tablet.

heater
======

Controls some motorized valves directing the output of an air heater.

mc8_tester
==========

A tester for the 8-pin connection system I use for the main wiring,
with connection names built in.

tacho
=====

Scales the output frequency of the alternator tacho connection to
match the requirements of the gauge.

upperwinch
==========

Soft-start controller for a small electric winch.
