Embedded controllers for my Land Rover

I rebuilt and stretched a Land Rover a few years ago, and am starting
to add some microcontrollers.

central
=======

An ADK Mega that looks at lots of status lines and communicates with
an Android tablet.

heater
======

Controls some motorized valves directing the output of an air heater.

tacho
=====

Scales the output frequency of the alternator tacho connection to
match the requirements of the gauge.
